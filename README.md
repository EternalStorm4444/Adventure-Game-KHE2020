# Colossal Scifi Adventure

Colossal SciFi adventure is a mini satire of text-based adventure games from the 80's. Your character, Valerian or Laureline, navigates a spaceship, solving puzzles and making decisions using a series of commands such as "left" or "up". Much like many original text-based adventure games, part of the fun of the game is figuring out the commands during gameplay. 

# Required Software
Python 3 is required to play Colossal SciFi Adventure. While you can technically get the game set up in any Python 3 editor
IDLE is fine to use. Python 3 IDLE can be downloaded here:

# Future and Background

Colossal SciFi adventure is an homage to text-based adventure games of the 80's. Some of the more famous of the 80's text-based adventure games 
were Collosal Cave Adventure which was a fantasy style game with a Dungeon's and Dragons style vibe and Zork, a slightly more advanced fantasy 
style adventure game. 

A modified version of Collosal Cave Adventure can be played online on AMC's website at the following link:

The story behind this project is actually a little funny. Collosal Scifi Adventure was original a sleep-deprived innovation conceived as a hackathon idea
during Kent Hack Enough 2020. Because the hackathon was retro (80's) themed it seemed like an awesome idea. We made it through the night coding in shifts but as 
morning rolled around we were still debugging from the night before. Around 6AM our team lost power as part of a power outage we later found out was caused 
by downed power lines that took out a whole chunk of other hackers in KHE. Even worst, we'd been relying pretty heavily on github and the only laptop with the
current code was out of power. There was no way to access the code from the night before. Normally this would have been one last push to the coffeeshop to finish 
the code before the noon deadline to submit our devposts but due to the Covid-19 pandemic it didn't seem responsible to rush out of the house during a virtual hackathon. 

So in the end Collosal SciFi Adventure became a longer term project and we continue to tweak and add features for fun even to this day.
